            <p>Hi, I’m Zach!
            </p>
            <p id=idt>
            I'm a 17 year old highschool student from Canada who enjoys digital visual arts, coding, web design, math, physics, and chemistry. In my free time I grow both terrestrial and aquatic plants. I plan to pursue digital arts, science, and math in my post secondary education as well as into my career. I’m currently in <abbr title="Digital Media Arts">DMA</abbr> 12, because I enjoy digital visual arts and coding and this course allows me to extend my knowledge in both of those areas.

                <h2>DMA 12 T Shirt Design</h2>
                <h3>Made in: Photoshop</h3>
                <p> This assignment had relatively loose guidelines, with the only thing required being an image made by us that we would use on a t-shirt or mask. I interpreted this as a design that is adaptable to either a t-shirt or mask. Used on a t-shirt it would be small and on the right or left side at chest level, possible with a larger design on the back of the shirt. Applied to a mask it would sit on either side of the face. It depicts a stream running through moss and a couple tropical plants. It has no text or additional features, only containing an image so that it is more versatile. Since there were not many requirements, if any, that I could meet, the creation and submission of the image was sufficient.

                <p> Ripped directly from the rubric, the criteria were as follows: the file structure is organized, save your work as a photoshop file as well as a JPEG, final artwork (10”x10” or 10”x14”) 300 Resolution CMYK Color, it is refined and ready to print. You have created your own geometric design and not simply copied the instructional sheet, and your design compliments the photo and creates visual unity. I easily met these criteria by first setting my photoshop workspace to 10”x10” 300 Resolution CMYK Color, and using photoshop in a way I regularly do (aka keep the files organised in folders). The product was made following a guide, but changing how I applied elements of the guide to better fit my image. The image is based off of a screen shot from a film I made with friends, where I am fighting my friend. Since I had artistic liberty I made it in space and used the geometric effects to make it look like some kind of superhuman fight.

                <h2>DMA 11 T Shirt Design</h2>
                <h3>Made in: Photoshop</h3>
                <p> For this assignment a key point of the design was to base it around our school’s theme of “Vision” that year. Another important element was text in some form, and it was to be submitted as a high quality jpeg, a digital mockup, and a photoshop psd file. I chose to interpret the theme of vision in my piece in two ways, through perspective and “vision for the future.” The piece uses a simple one point perspective in order to draw your attention towards the nuclear explosion which is a part of the second application of the theme. The quote at the top along with the explosion portrays a bleak vision for the future, one of nuclear war, and mass death. The shirt uses this kind of vision as a warning. I did submit the project in all required formats, and included a quote for my text as previously stated.

                <h2>Low Poly Design
                </h2>
                <h3>Made in: Photoshop</h3>
                <p> The requirements for this project were not quite as strict and defined as many are. It was simply to find a photoshop tutorial online that I could apply, and then apply it. The technique used here was long and arduous, using the blur average and polygonal selection tool. I took an image of a frog and, through following the tutorial, reduced the entire image into something reminiscent of earlier videogames with the same kind of “low poly” (low polygon) graphics. Lastly I chose a background that wouldn’t distract from the main piece, but still feel cohesive. This led me to add a relatively blurry leafy green background.

                <h2>Personal Photoshop Project
                </h2>
                <h3>Made in: Photoshop</h3>
                <p> Being a personal project I didn’t have specific requirements, I did however have a reason for creating the piece. I needed this piece to bridge between a couple photos in a gallery type setup. Since the idea was to bridge two images, I made a bridge with a person on either side. The image was designed at the needed size of 1800px wide and 900px tall. The people on either side of the bridge are the people in the galery, and the palette used primarily in the piece is the same as in the galery. This piece fits the aesthetic and function it was required to fill, as it was designed with it’s purpose constantly in mind.

To do this I completed all of the requirements for all of the python assignments in one. The requirements included: random function, variables, integers, input/output, print, while loops, if/else statements, strings, and lists. I was able to meet all of these criteria easily due to the nature of my project. I created a randomly generated text based dungeon crawler, which means I had to use all of these things and more in order to create a cohesive game. I also used things like dictionaries to create a relatively interactive shop system. The game itself works in iterations where defeating enemies first rewards you, makes the game harder, and brings you closer to finding the boss. The game has many different endings, and easter eggs to boot, and the module nature of the game makes it infinitely expandable. It has been my favourite project in DMA this year, and is a game that I myself find entertaining to play.

This assignment was in our blended learning half of the quarter, which means the guidelines and rubric for this assignment were designed by us. I used portions from the premier pro module rubric to inform my requirements for this video assignment. These requirements are: Shoot decent shots with acceptable lighting and audio, include a variety of different, artfully arranged film shots, include artful camera movement where appropriate (pan, tilt, tracking, zoom), include quality film editing and a variety of transitions, include a soundtrack in at least part of the film, length is flexible, but it should be between 5 and 10 minutes long, submitted in mp4 format. I met these requirements by filming creative transitions and then piecing them together to appear more seamless and adding a suitable piece of music that faded in and out depending on the context. As far as camera movement goes it was hard to get creative since I had to film and be in the shot at the same time. The video was about 8 minutes long, which is right in the middle of the required time.

            <h3>Made in: Adobe Animate</h3>
            <p>The requirements of the project were to make a loopable animation video, preferably submitted in mp4 and the native animation filetype .fla (flash filetype). We were also supposed to have a holiday greeting somewhere in the animation, and to provide some sort of cohesive story within your animation. I met these criteria, although I didn’t complete the whole story I had storyboarded, the reindeer snaps back into place at the end in a way that allows the animation to be looped. The animation contains the phrase “Have a Holly, Jolly Christmas!” This appears near the end of the loop, and was added according to the phrase I submitted at the beginning of the project. It was submitted in the proper formats, and uploaded to youtube so it could be accessed as a link.
